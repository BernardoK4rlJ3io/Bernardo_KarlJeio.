Project: Create a Token
Letâ€™s Create a Token, Together!

High-level programming language Solidity was created especially for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum network.


DESCRIPTION:
A Solidity contract for a basic ERC-20 coin is presented in the following software. Learning the fundamentals of this software will be beneficial for new programmers.

HOW TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM?
> Copy the Solidity code you provided.
> Open a Solidity IDE or connect to a local blockchain client.
> Paste the code into the IDE or client editor.
> Compile the code. This checks for syntax errors and translates the code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.
Deploy the contract. This uploads the bytecode to the blockchain network (either simulated or real).Compile the code. This checks for syntax errors and translates the code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.
Deploy the contract. This uploads the bytecode to the blockchain network (either simulated or real).
> Interact with the contract functions. You can use the IDE or client interface to call functions like mint and burn, specifying the necessary parameters (like address and amount).

Note:

You'll need a Solidity compiler to turn the human-readable code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can comprehend.
